# About
This project spawned out of a coworker's need to move a large 
amount of data from an Excel spreadsheet into an odd spreadsheet
app that did not allow multi-cell copy and paste from excel. I used a 
combination of xlwings and pyautogui to move the data over.

While this has limited use outside of my specific work situation,
parts of the code may be useful to someone else facing the challenge
of moving large amounts of data into an app that does not allow for
multi-cell pasting.

## Install / Run
Python 3.6 or higher recommended, Windows required. Navigate to the directory of the 
repo and run the following:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 grade_manager.py
```
